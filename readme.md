# notes on solidity

Basics:

Smart contracts are compiled and compressed,
and then deployed onto the blockchain.

When deployed, each contract gets granted an `address`.
This means that multiple instances of the same contract can be deployed!

Once deployed, contract protocols can never be changed or deleted.
(However their data may change.)




# Writing contracts:

Check out this online IDE, its really good:

https://remix.ethereum.org/
(BTW: It says eth.org, but Solidity can be used with many blockchains!)


Also you can deploy your contract to a test-blockchain
by specifying `JavaScript VM (London) | (Berlin)` as the
environment.


If you want to deploy to the actual blockchain,
deploy with `Injected Web3`. This will cost money, as the miners
will have to put the contract on their machines.

NEVER PUT YOUR CONTRACT ON A PoW BLOCKCHAIN!!!!
SHITS SO EXPENSIVE!!!!!!
